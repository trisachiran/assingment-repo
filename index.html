                <h2>shelter for a family</h2>
                <p>We build the memories that turn into what we are, then what we were, as we
                    look
                    back. We live in the
                    light that comes to us.” “Every man is a shelter for himself in the desert.” “Many times,
                    'shelter
                    from
                    the storm' is the 'hope' of not perishing in the storm for the lack of shelter within it.”</p>

                <p>It is in fact a part of the function of education to help us escape, not from
                    our
                    own time – for we
                    are
                    bound by that—but from the intellectual and emotional limitations of our time.</p>
